# CISC/CMPE 204: Assignment 2

Welcome to the project for assignment 2 in CISC/CMPE 204. This project covers propositional logic semantics, and includes
questions on reformulating propositional formulae using known equivalences.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository or open it in Repl.It (a button should appear in this repository on GitHub -- refresh may be necessary)
    - If you are new to Git / GitHub, or just want a refresher, see [here](https://guides.github.com/).
    - **Tip**: You may need to go to Repl.It first, log in, and _then_ open this project using the button. Not doing so can be buggy at times.

2. Add your personal `config.py` file to the repository, replacing the one that's there. A link to it will have been provided in the assignment in OnQ.

3. Follow the instructions in `run.py` to complete questions 1 and 2 of the assignment.

4. Follow the instructions in `Q3.md` to complete the final question.

5. Commit and push your changes. You should see a check-mark on the repository if the submission passes.
    - This is not an automatically graded assignment. It simply runs some checks (see `test.py`) to make sure your submission is in the right format.

## Tip

If the auto-grading isn't working for whatever reason, you can test things yourself by running `pytest test.py` or simply adding `test_submission()` to `test.py` before running `python test.py`.

## Help

See the demo video in the course Tutorials (OnQ > CISC/CMPE 204 > Content > Tutorials) that demonstrates much of GitHub and Repl.It, as it pertains to this assignment.
