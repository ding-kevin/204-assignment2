# Question 3

What should be on the quiz?

If you had control of building a quiz to assess knowledge of what the students in 204 learned for propositional semantics,
what question would you ask? Keep in mind that there are roughly 3-4 questions / quiz, and only 60min in total.

Only constraint is that you shouldn't just mirror one of the assignment or weekly practice questions. Try to be creative, and
the best questions very well may appear on a future quiz!
